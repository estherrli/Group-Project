- Why are you interested in this field/domain?  
Our domain of interest is the streaming site Netflix. We are interested in Netflix because this platform is a media that we use 
on a day to day basis. Although this is a commonly used streaming site, we do not understand what data they track and what data 
they use to predict and/or make recommendations, or any other purposes they may use our data for, so we are interested in exploring more about this topic.

- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?  
[Netflix Prize Data](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data?fbclid=IwAR0V2GJNG-iFmPBzOW35a0wICgwnQS38sSplFp9kkSpHlyAwLIzBcCfER9c)  
One data project that we found in this domain was the Netflix Prize competition that occured in 2009. This data project essentially encompassed Netflix giving out a large dataset of previous user ratings on different movies an TV shows to allow others to write a program that would successfully predict future ratings. However, this dataset turned out to be an invasion of privacy of users, as the data allowed for individuals to be tracked down through their ratings on Netflix.

    Another data project we found on Netflix explores techniques content providers can use to positively influence user perception and investigate the power of setting user expectations. It specifically explores video quality on online streaming sites versus on-demand and how user expectations vary depending on the platform.

    [Artwork Personalization at Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/artwork-personalization-c589f074ad76)  
    This project is about Netflix's use of machine learning and user engagement data to display television show and movie titles/images that are based on preferences and interests. The project
    explores the use of different thumbnails to pique a variety of different users' interests, which proved to be an effective method of improving user engagement.

    These datasets tell us what kind of movies and TV shows are trending, and when they were released. This answers part of our question of what type of data does Netflix take from us? Clearly, this shows that Netflix takes into account what we watch and when we watched it, in order to get the data on which show/movie is doing well.
